# RustJourney - My Learning Path with Rust

Welcome to **RustJourney**! This repository is a collection of over 50 small projects, demos, and exercises that document my journey in learning the Rust programming language. These projects are a reflection of my continuous exploration of Rust’s core concepts and advanced features, ranging from basic syntax to real-world applications.

Each project serves as a milestone, representing the challenges I've faced and the skills I've acquired. Whether you are new to Rust or looking for inspiration for your own projects, you’ll find a wide variety of examples here.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language designed for performance, reliability, and memory safety. It offers powerful concurrency features and is known for its zero-cost abstractions, meaning you can write high-level code with no sacrifices in performance. Rust is a great choice for a variety of applications, from low-level systems programming to web development and blockchain technologies.

By documenting my Rust learning journey, I aim to share the insights and challenges I encounter with others. These projects will help solidify my understanding of Rust and give back to the vibrant Rust community.

## Project List

This repository is a collection of small projects that cover a wide range of Rust topics. Some of the areas you will find here include:

- **Rust Basics**: Syntax, variables, control flow, functions, and more.
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Learning about memory safety and how Rust handles ownership and references.
- **Pattern Matching & Error Handling**: Using enums, pattern matching, and `Result` types.
- **Concurrency and Async Programming**: Implementing multithreading and asynchronous programming using Rust's unique concurrency features.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implementing common data structures and algorithms in Rust.
- **WebAssembly**: Exploring how to compile Rust code to WebAssembly.
- **File I/O and CLI Applications**: Creating command-line tools and working with file input/output.
- **External Crates**: Integrating third-party libraries to extend functionality.

Each project is self-contained and includes explanations and comments to help you understand the core concepts behind it.
